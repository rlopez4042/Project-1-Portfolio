## Project Description

This project is a personal portfolio website which will highlight other projects, and websites that I hope to design. It will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and any additional libraries such as bootstrap that may provide useful resources. My intention is to create a site that is Responsive, Dynamic, and Intuitive to navigate. It be built with a Mobile First design, and will utilize dynamic transitions as the user scrolls through the site, helping it come to life.
